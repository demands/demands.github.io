			<h1>Imaginary but awesome: Book annotation</h1>
			<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>When I&#146;m reading a book, I often have to stop because a particular passage inspires me, annoys me, confuses me, or reminds me of something. I write notes in the margin for later&#133; but when I&#146;m finally in a state of mind to act on what I wrote, I don&#146;t remember that I wrote anything.</p>
<p>Other times, while I&#146;m reading I would be interested to see what other readers thought about a specific passage, or I want to let other people know what I think.</p>
<h2>A possible solution</h2>This&#146;d be a pretty sweet application of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality" title="Wikipedia article">augmented reality</a>. Strap on your AR goggles and all of a sudden, you&#146;d see something like this: <img src="http://blog.maxedmands.com/images/ar_books.jpg"><p>I&#146;m envisioning something like <a href="http://google.com/sidewiki">Google Sidewiki</a>, except for books in real life. We don&#146;t have the tech for this yet, but maybe in a few years?</p>		</div>
