			<h1>Treehuggers are not effective environmentalists</h1>
			<p><img src="http://blog.maxedmands.com/images/treehuggers.jpg" alt="A photograph of a treehugger" title="This image is by Jcesare on en.wikipedia"></p>

<p>In 2007, someone anonymous wrote <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/sfo/466281874.html" title="An open letter to Berkeley tree-sitters.">a letter</a> to UC Berkeley environmentalists who were protesting cutting down trees by sitting in them. Here is an excerpt:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consider what you are fighting for.
  How many trees does UC intend to destroy
  for its construction project? (Answer: 38).
  Is the coast live oak an endangered or
  threatened species? (Answer: No). Will the
  removal of these individual trees have any
  significant impact on the health of the
  overall population of the species? (Answer:
  No). Consider how many collective man-hours
  your campaign has devoted to saving these
  trees. Has it occurred to you that your time
  may be better spent focusing on (for
  example) the huge swaths of the Amazon that
  are cut down by loggers and developers every
  day? Are you choosing to protect 38 trees
  because you really think it is a
  significant, meaningful cause? I hope not&mdash;
  because that would be ignorant. It seems
  much more likely that you choose this battle
  because it is relatively convenient and
  riskless. Honestly&mdash;why don&rsquo;t you sac up and
  take on a <em>real</em> environmental offender?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I found a link to this letter on <a href="http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/treehuggers-wasting-time/" title="Article entitled 'Why are these treehuggers wasting their time?'">I Will Teach You to be Rich</a>, a financial blog. (The blogger&rsquo;s name is Ramit Sethi. You should read his <a href="http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/book/" title="It's also called 'I Will Teach You to be Rich'.">book</a>. It&rsquo;s awesome.) The things that Ramit talks about, though, are about more than just money management. He writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You&#146;ll find a lot of people doing largely
  meaningless things and justifying it with
  these 4 terrible words: &#147;It can&#146;t hurt,
  right?&#148;</p>
  
  <p>But it can. We&#146;re cognitive misers. We only
  have limited attention and limited
  willpower. And with limited time, are you
  focusing on stuff that will make no
  difference? Or are you saving your limited
  attention and cognition for areas that will
  really make a difference?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Being an environmentalist is stressful. From all sides the world is being bombarded with intense environmental crises (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;tbs=rltm:1&amp;q=BP+oil+spill">oil in the Gulf</a>, <a href="http://www.mongabay.com/brazil.html">Amazon deforestation</a>, <a href="http://www.nrdc.org/globalwarming/qthinice.asp">the polar ice caps melting</a>, or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_Garbage_Patch">Pacific Trash Vortex</a>, just to name a few). More than half of the human population doesn&rsquo;t care, and most of the people who do care are too overwhelmed to do anything.</p>

<p>The rest of us? We spend time fighting small battles. Like the Berkeley activists who sat in trees. But it&rsquo;s not just them, this problem plagues the entire environmental community! For example, when I was the president of my college environmental club, we spent most of our time and energy on campus improvements. We rearranged recycling bins on campus, so that they would be in more convenient locations. We encouraged students to turn off their lights more often.</p>

<p>No wonder environmentalists get the nickname &ldquo;treehuggers.&rdquo; We seem inept. Most of us are not acting at our full potential. We&rsquo;re not making the changes that actually matter.</p>

<p>So here is my appeal to all people who call themselves environmentalists, wherever you live. If you are concerned about the planet, don&rsquo;t be a treehugger. Think about how you can most effectively change the world.</p>

				<div class="comment_text">Okay - I see your point - but what exactly do you propose we spend our "limited cognition" doing?  Write a letter saying "Please don't cut down the amazon?"  I just don't see the harm in taking care of the things we can control when the bigger problems are out of our sphere of influence.  I don't own the polar ice caps or the amazon rain forest any more than any environmental offender, and so what can I really do? What say do I have?  I am not asking these as rhetorical questions - because I understand your point, and I want to be doing something that will actually make a difference.  What do you do?<br>
Yes, there are big environmental problems in the world, much bigger than some 38 oak trees, much bigger than the wasted electricity if I leave my light on - but these big problems are the symptoms of a disease that has been festering for centuries.  If we expect to come by real and lasting changes, we have to adopt a drastic change of lifestyle.  It is a paradigm shift, a revolution of values that must occur on the individual level, because it cannot be legally enforced without violating individual rights.<br>
And as long as we have not made the small changes in our individual lives, the changes that cost us so little more than a thought, how can we expect desperate campesinos in Central and South America to stop slashing and burning when it is the source of their immediate livelihood?</div>

				<div class="comment_text">@Omar: I'm with you 100%; the environmental problems we're dealing with these days are ridiculously daunting, to the point that they seem completely impossible to tackle. And they might actually *be* impossible to tackle.<br><br>
On the other hand, I think it's a trillion times more constructive to be proactive and create positive change as opposed to resisting negative change. Instead of trying to preserve 38 oak trees from untimely destruction by sitting in them all day, or rearranging recycling bins in the common area of a college in the hope that it will inspire some hapless undergraduate to recycle his soda bottle instead of just throwing it away, it seems much more productive to spend your time doing things that inspire you. (See my next post, http://blog.maxedmands.com/post/rules-for-neurotic-environmentalists, for my thoughts on why doing stuff that makes you happy might actually be beneficial for the environment.)<br><br>
I believe with all my heart that if humanity progresses to the point where everyone does what inspires them instead of doing whatever they feel they need to do because society tells them it's important, those desperate campesinos in Central and South America won't need to be deforesting the Amazon in order to eat. Perhaps I'll find the time sometime soon to back up this theory with a full post :)</div>

				<div class="comment_text">Paul Cienfuegos has quite a lot to say about the futility of focusing on single issues, such as the tree huggers you describe as well as other single-issue campaigners (and not just environmentalists). For example, from his "Corporations versus People" address (http://flagindistress.com/2011/03/corporations-versus-people/), I clipped the following:<br><br>
"Many of us ... join regional and national advocacy organizations, but they tend to be so isolated from their members that they barely request more of us than writing a letter to an elected official or to the editor of a local paper or signing an online petition or sending a donation. These larger groups are also almost always focused on a single issue, and frequently much of their funding comes from large corporations. Sometimes their boards of directors are CEOs of large corporations. Two examples are the Natural Resources Defense Council and the American Cancer Society.<br><br>
"These are all fine things for us to be doing, to be re- examining our daily, private lifestyle decisions so we consume less and to be joining mostly single-issue organizations. But I have to ask you. Is this sufficient to get Portland, to get Oregon, to get the U.S. turned 180 degrees in the next 10 to 20 years? I think we need to be honest and say no. The harsh reality is that even given the gazillion hours that activists work year after year, almost every single ecological and social trend continues to get worse and worse and worse."<br><br>
His solution is to focus instead on corporations, and how they have over the past century and a half taken power away from people. The entire address is well worth reading, as is this more recent one, http://flagindistress.com/2012/01/we-the-people/ , with very positive and practical advice about how we might restore popular control over chartered corporations--including straying from our comfort zones and forming alliances with those who appear on first sight to be 180 degrees opposite from us in political and social values. </div>
