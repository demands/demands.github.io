title: Rules for Neurotic Environmentalists, or how to consume without feeling guilty about it
category: notes

Every now and again I find myself doing something awesome, but feeling guilty
about it afterwards because of the associated environmental impact. Like when I
drive for hours to visit far-away friends. Or like when I eat [something
delicious][86] that contains meat.

I know I'm not the only one who gets neurotic about this stuff. I mean, I live
in San Francisco, a city that seems to be full of crazy environmentalists like
me, or at least people who [pay lip-service to the idea of
environmentalism][87]. And I've got a college friend who ABSOLUTELY LOVES TO
HIKE. He's been hitting the trails every weekend. When he gets home he guilt
trips for hours about the gas it took him to get to the trailhead.

One afternoon, while he and I were chatting back and forth on Google, bemoaning
the fact that we can't do what we enjoy without killing the environment, I had
an epiphany. I want to share it with you.

It starts with a somewhat depressing thought: You are correct: Absolutely
everything that we do, as humans, has a destructive environmental impact. No
matter how hard we try, it is completely impossible to take ourselves out of
nature and let it continue without us. Species are going to become endangered;
relative amounts of atmospheric chemicals are going to change. The things that
we do tweak the way that the environment around us operates. Shit happens.
Sometimes people die.

Fortunately, there's a corresponding optimistic thought that goes along with the
depressing one:

Destruction and creation are, to a certain extent, linked. Change isn't all bad.
Small forest fires decrease the risk of larger, more destructive forest fires.
Sure, the dinosaurs went extinct. But if they had stayed around, mammals
(such as, for example, humans!), wouldn't be around now, right? Stress yourself less &mdash;
sometimes things don't matter as much as we think they do.

That's not to say, though, that it's okay for factories to [release pesticides
into the air and kill tons of people][88]. There is a happy medium for an amount
of environmental destruction that I hope we can all agree on:

## Three rules for guilt-free environmental destruction

<ol><li>Figure out what all the things are that make you really, truly
happy.</li>
<li>Do those things with reckless, wild abandon. If life isn't about enjoying
the things you love, what is it about?</li>
<li>Eliminate all the stuff from your life that doesn't make you happy. Stop
consuming, if the consumption is related to these things.</li>
</ol>
There. Super simple. We can't get away from destroying the environment. That's
what life is, really; a process of continued and rampant environmental
destruction! Embrace the truth! So. Instead of destroying the environment doing
stupid stuff, and then whining about it, let's have fun while we're about it?

And while you're listening, here are some other helpful hints to help you
process / assuage your environmentally-induced guilty conscience:

## Some hints

+   When you've done something, think about whether that thing made you as happy
    as you thought it would. If they didn't make you happy, don't do it again.
+   Know your impact, and make careful choices. Be aware, for example, that the
    cow youâ€™re eating might have been pumped full of toxic growth hormones and
    soy-based feed that is linked to deforestation in the Amazon. Own the fact
    that motherboard in your cellphone was manufactured using chemicals that
    came from [all over the world][89]. Be aware. And know that if having a cell
    phone or eating a cow is worth it to you, that's okay.
+   Experiment with simplicity. For example: turn off your TV for a week. See if
    you like it more. Or, ride your bike to work instead of taking your car. See
    if you like that more.
+   If you've figured out how to be happy, be contagious about it! Try and make
    other people happier too. If everyone in the world was happier, I believe
    environmental problems would matter a lot less.
