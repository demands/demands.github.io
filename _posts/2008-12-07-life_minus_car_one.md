I have been without a car for a little bit over a week now, and so far it hasn’t been too much of a problem. Rides to school and home haven’t been a difficult thing to arrange, given that a lot of people from Clarkson seem to live in my area. And while here in Potsdam, I’ve taken my bicycle to go shopping once, and again for a theatre rehearsal at the stage in [Old Snell][snell]. The first ride was very cold; the second time I learned my lesson and wore a warm hat and gloves.

While at home, things will be a bit more challenging. It seems like the Woodstock and West Hurley areas are built specifically so that people are forced to drive there cars everywhere, even if it’s right around the block to the grocery store. (The [WalkScore][walkscore] at my house is 5 out of a possible 100&hellip; "car dependent." And I live just outside of town. Compare this to the WalkScore at Clarkson, a 72 out of 100, or "very walkable.") I find this really sad. In general, Woodstock is a very progressive community.

In 2003, the Director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (a government organization) [said that obesity was the #1 health threat][obesity] in the United States, more prevalent than tobacco, and more dangerous than bioterrorism. What’s more, the [correlation][noimpactman] between obesity and car use is [striking][wapo]: Our cars are probably making us fat!

I look forward to the day (and I know it will come) that we [build more sidewalks][citytank] and [live closer together][nrdc].
