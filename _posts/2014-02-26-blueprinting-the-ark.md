I'm in the middle of Neal Stephenson's <cite>Quicksilver</cite> right now. It's
historical fiction about the [Age of
Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment), and there's
this anecdote about a scientist who is attempting to create a
[taxonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy_%28biology%29#Pre-Linnaean_taxonomists)
of plants and animals.  The scientist is, unfortunately, distracted from this
task by an urgent and troubling concern:

> ...it occurred to me that (going back to Genesis, sixth chapter, verses
> fifteen through twenty-two) Noah must have found a way to fit all of these
> creatures into one gopher-wood tub three hundred cubits long! ... Which makes
> it imperative that I include, in a separate chapter, a complete plan of
> Noah's Ark&mdash;demonstrating not only where each of the beasts was
> berthed, but also the fodder for the herbivorous beasts, and live cattle for
> the carnivorous oenes, and *more* fodder yet to keep the cattle alive, long
> enough to be eaten by the carnivores&mdash;were, I say, &rsquo;twas all stowed.

In hindsight, the distraction of the Ark is completely beside the point of
creating the Taxonomy, and yet because of the cultural context in which the
scientist is working, it seems to be a worthwhile use of their time.

I was particularly struck by this because I keep running into a similar problem
while in my travels as a software engineer. Sometimes I find myself building
  big systems and writing lots of code, just to make a component interact
  "seamlessly" with a different component. Alternatively, I do this so that I
  can continue organizing code in a certain way, even though the tool I am
  trying to integrate with expects code written in a different way.

For lack of a better term, from now on I'm going to refer to this practice as
"blueprinting the Ark". Is this a documented phenomenon?
