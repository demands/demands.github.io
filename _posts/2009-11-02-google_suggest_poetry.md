Are you an aspiring poet who can’t figure out why you’re not making any money? You probably should have realized that this would happen the moment you bought your first Moleskine. If you want to sell out, however, the power of Google Suggest will ensure that your poems will, at least, resound well with the public.

Just start with a word or two. Type them into your Google search box, pick the most poem-like result, and go on to the next line. Encourage sentence-style results by sprinkling a few "is"s and "are"s in your queries. To stay with a theme, make sure your next few words are related to the first few.

Not only will this get you published and rolling in disposable cash, it’s also fun! Here is an example. The seed words are in \[square brackets].

>  \[how long] how long does weed stay in your system<br>
>  \[your system] your system is infected<br>
>  \[your] your baby can read<br>
>  \[read] read books online free<br>
>  \[books] books to read before you die<br>
>  \[you die] you die in the game you die in real life movie<br>
>  \[real life is] real life is overrated<br>
>  \[real life is] real life islamic stories<br>
>  \[is real] is real hair real<br>
>  \[are hair] are hair extensions worth it<br>
>  \[extensions] extensions are not enabled<br>

Now, add punctuation and spacing for something truly professional:

>  How long does weed stay in your system?<br>
>  Your system is infected.<br>
>  Your baby can read, read books online free.<br>
>  Books to read before you die.<br>
>  You die in the game, you die in real life.<br>
>  Movie. Real life is overrated.<br>
>  Real life Islamic stories: Is Real Hair Real?<br>
>  Are hair extensions worth it?<br>
>  Extensions are not enabled.<br>

Such is the awesome power of Google Suggest.
