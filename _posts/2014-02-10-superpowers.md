We all have a superpower. And if you're reading this, I'm putting it at 75%
likely that yours has something to do with making computers do cool stuff. It's
a lucky superpower to have, in this day and age, since it usually implies
things like a decent salary, stock options, and company lunch. Plus you get to
build things; exercise the creative parts of your brain.

Knowing how to program makes so many things much easier. It's not hard to find
a job, because there are so many people hiring -- at the same time as many of
our non-engineering friends are trying in vain to find anything that remotely
resembles a career in this new economy. Which is why a lot of us just sort of
tumble into a job straight out of school, and when things quit working out so
great, we sort of coast right into the next one.

There is a big problem with this. The thing about superpowers is that they are
powerful agents for change. The work that we do is changing the world. And we
need to be conscious of exactly what kind of change we are creating.
