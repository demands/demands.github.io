## Headcanon
Headcanon is an idea, belief or aspect of a characterâ€™s personality or
physicality that is present in a piece of fanwork that does not correspond with
information present in the canonical material. - [Know Your
Meme](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/headcanon)

## MacGuffin
A plot device in the form of some goal, desired object, or other motivator that
the protagonist pursues, often with little or no narrative explanation. The
specific nature of a MacGuffin is typically unimportant to the overall plot. -

## Thought Technology
A way of thinking about things that causes you to understand *other* things more
effectively. For example, take this [list of cognitive biases on
Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases). Reading and
understanding any of the biases in this list will, at least in theory, inoculate
you slightly against making these sorts of mistakes in your thinking in the
future. - h.t. John Roderick and Merlin Mann, from their excellent podcast
[Roderick on the Line](http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/)

## Soloverse
Our mental model of the universe, which also happens to be our only direct
experience of the universe and the only way we have of understanding it, since
everything that we sense about it travels through the filter of our brain first.
